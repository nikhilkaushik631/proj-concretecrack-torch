# Linear Classifier with PyTorch

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to implement a linear classifier using PyTorch to solve a classification problem. This serves as a fundamental step before moving on to deep learning models. The goal is to evaluate the performance of a simple linear model on the dataset and understand the model's structure and functionality.

## Introduction
In this notebook, we use a **linear classifier**, one of the simplest machine learning models, to solve a classification problem. Linear classifiers attempt to separate classes using a linear decision boundary. Before using more complex models, linear classifiers are helpful as a baseline to ensure your dataset is properly structured and can be classified to some extent.

The notebook guides you through:
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset.
- Defining and training a linear classifier using the PyTorch framework.
- Evaluating the performance of the classifier over multiple epochs to see how the model improves.

### Linear Classifier
A linear classifier is a supervised learning model that makes predictions based on the weighted sum of the input features. If the data is linearly separable, this type of classifier works well. Even when the data is not linearly separable, it provides a useful baseline to compare more complex models against.

### Model Workflow:
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The dataset is loaded and preprocessed into a format suitable for the PyTorch model.
   - Data is split into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - The classifier is a single-layer neural network without hidden layers. It takes the input features and directly applies a linear transformation to them.
   - The linear transformation is defined as:
     \[
     y = XW + b
     \]
     Where:
     - \(X\) is the input data (features).
     - \(W\) is the weight matrix.
     - \(b\) is the bias term.
     - \(y\) is the output (logits), which is then used for predictions.

3. **Softmax and Loss Function**:
   - The output logits are passed through a **Softmax** function to convert them into a probability distribution for each class.
   - The loss is calculated using the **Cross-Entropy Loss**, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.

4. **Optimizer**:
   - The model parameters (weights and bias) are updated using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**. This minimizes the loss function and improves the model’s accuracy over time.

5. **Training**:
   - The model is trained for several epochs. In each epoch, the model adjusts its weights based on the loss and optimizer's feedback.
   - During training, both the training loss and accuracy are monitored to track the model's improvement.

6. **Validation**:
   - After training, the model is validated on a separate dataset to evaluate its generalization performance.
   - The validation accuracy is calculated after each epoch, and the model’s performance is compared based on accuracy.

## How the Model Works:
### 1. **Input Layer**: 
   The input to the linear classifier consists of feature vectors from the dataset. Each input feature represents an attribute of the data point (e.g., pixel values for image data).

### 2. **Linear Transformation**:
   The input features are passed through a linear transformation:
   \[
   z = XW + b
   \]
   - \(X\) is the input.
   - \(W\) is the weight matrix learned during training.
   - \(b\) is the bias term.
   
   This transformation maps the input features to the corresponding output logits.

### 3. **Softmax Function**:
   The logits are passed through the Softmax function, which converts them into class probabilities:
   \[
   p_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
   \]
   Where \(p_i\) represents the probability of class \(i\).

### 4. **Cross-Entropy Loss**:
   The model's loss function is the cross-entropy loss, which compares the predicted probability distribution with the true labels:
   \[
   L = - \sum_i y_i \log(p_i)
   \]
   This loss is minimized during training to improve the model's predictions.

### 5. **Optimization**:
   Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the model updates the weights and biases to minimize the loss function. This process is repeated over several epochs, allowing the model to gradually improve.
